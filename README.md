# Internship Project Repository:
Welcome to the repository for my internship project with Codsoft!

## Overview:
In this repository, you'll find the codebase and resources related to my internship project in the field of data science. The project focuses on machine learning models using Python and 1 predictive model using Excel.

## Project Structure:
**Data Exploration**: This directory contains notebooks and scripts for exploring the dataset, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial analysis.

**Model Development**: Here, you can find the development of machine learning models, including experimentation with different algorithms, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

**Documentation**: This directory includes any project documentation such as project plans, reports, and presentations.

**Resources**: Additional resources, such as datasets used, relevant research papers, and external libraries, are stored here.

## How to Use:
**Prerequisites**:
* Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from here.
* Install Jupyter Notebook using pip:
  pip install notebook
**Getting Started**:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/TFk2003/CODSOFT or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:
  jupyter notebook
4. This will open a new browser window/tab with the Jupyter Notebook interface.
5. Navigate to the appropriate directory (e.g., Data Exploration, Model Development) to access the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb).
6. Click on the notebook file you want to work with to open it.
7. Follow the instructions and execute the code cells within the notebook to interact with the project.
**Additional Notes**:
* Make sure to install any required Python packages listed in the notebooks using pip or conda.
* Feel free to modify the notebooks and experiment with the code to better understand the project or explore different approaches.
